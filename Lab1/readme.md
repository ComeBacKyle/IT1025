Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
