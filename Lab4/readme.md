## Executive Summary  

Within Lab 4 I will go through an IDLE python shell to run code as well as write a program to introduce myself and tell my age. Topics discussed include Graphics, variables and different file compression types. For this lab there are screenshot included to show program completed and the output. 

## Python IDLE 

The python interactive shell runs code one line at a time is good for experimenting and doing trial and error. 

File Editor is used for running complete programs 

  

## Code Examples 

### Variable:  

A way to store values in your code. 

### Assignment statement: 

the statement that attaches the value to the variable. 

### Function:  

Built in code that can make writing code much easier an example is Len(). 

  

### Three data types: 

Int- 3 

floats - 3.14 

strings- "Hello World" 

  

## Graphics 

  

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics 

Raster graphics are made of millions of pixels, while Vector graphics are made of anchor points, these anchor point go along with mathematical formulas and coordinates. With raster graphics having a limited number of pixels as they get larger, they get blurry. Vector graphics are able to mathematically correct themselves thus scaling will not affect their quality. Along with that the larger a raster graphic is the more pixels it needs, that also increases the overall file size. Raster graphics are better used for detailed images, Vector graphics are better used for logos and text. 

### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression 

It matters weather a developer uses lossless vs. Lossy because taking into account a developer may need to compress multiple different images using a simple algorithm to do so may save time and energy. However, if you only have a few images to compress lossy gives you the ability to combine methods and create even smaller sized files. 

### File Formats 

Jpg, gif, Png 

Both GIF and PNG are bitmapped image formats, one of the main differences that gives GIF an advantage is that it supports animated images. PNG though it has the ability to support transparency options. PNG uses a lossless compression method, while jpg choose to use a lossy compression method. Because JPG uses a lossy compression method it is prone to have to save images with a higher quality rate and increased size overall. 

### File Properties 

  

## Conclusion 

 In conclusion what I have learned from Lab 4 is, defining a variable in python. Using IDLE to help write code for python. File/Image compression, using both lossy and lossless compression. I also learned the difference between both compression types. File formats: JPG, GIF, PNG, and the difference between them. How PNG and JPG use different compression methods, and GIF and PNG are both bitmapped. Lastly, I learned about the difference between vector and raster graphics, and how each one should and can be used.
