### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
  Mechanical Latency gives a more in depth idea of a hard drives performance. Having the ability to provide feedback on both the seeking time and the latency give a broader picture of the hard drives stats. In comparison to the transfer rates which give a more simplified snapshot of the hards drives performance. thinking of it in terms of reading, transfer rates give us a readers digest, as the latency could give us the whole story. Something that could compare to the transfer rate is the access time, Which includes seeking time as well as latency and output. Similar to the transfer rate it can give a brief overview. When we talk about what is wanted in an ideal situation the best thing to hope for is to have high transfer rates with low latency. This represents a high performance hard drive with low lag in its ability to recall data.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
  There are a few difference between SSD and a traditional hard drive. The first is the functionality of the hard ware itself. With a Traditional hard drive having so many pieces and moving parts to it, it becomes more of a liability when comparing it to SSD. One small thing could break and then you’d be out of luck. The minimal amounts of moving parts as well as the size of the SSD, keeps it from being susceptible to dust entering or any moving part having a malfunction. Another difference between the two is speed. Because of the before mentioned moving parts. The hard drive can bring in a bit of latency, this showing in the seeking time, as the disk and spindle have to coordinate in efforts to find the data that is need. Even with all parts moving like a well oiled machine the hard drive still presents a bit of a slowed just based on having more to do. The SSD on the other hand doesn’t present the same problem. Because all of its functionality is ran through NAND and sometime SDRAM, all of the data that has to be recalled almost at your fingertips. This is the same processes for fragmented data as well.

#### Random Access Memory
  RAM is a critical component on a computer.  There are a few reasons why you would want to increase your RAM. One of the most obvious reasons is because it Speeds up your computer, with a larger amount of RAM you are also increasing the amount of information you are able to output.  Another reason is that with a larger amount of RAM you are taking the workload off the hard drive, thus allowing that to maintain its top speeds. The difference between a 32 and 64 bit path is pretty simple, 64 bit path transfers 64 bits of information per clock cycle in comparison to only doing half that for the 32 bit path.
### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU sits inside the CPU along side the Control unit and is responsible for all the math problems that need to be done.
The ALU receives instruction from the Control UNIt  and then preforms the tasks that is asked of it.

### CPU, Input & Output
So in the situation of the gas station, The actual pump would act as the CPU. The customer would then input money to represent the amount of gas they would want. And the Output would be the gas that comes out.
### Logic Gates
A truth table simply gives a visual of possible outcomes for a logic gate. With a and logic gate the truth table would have an output for instances where the both inputs are switched on. So there are limited outputs. The difference with a OR is that any input would result in an output.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE has a strong focus on ethics, IEEE understand the amount of power that tech can have on the world. Their purpose is to uphold ethics and practice ethical behavior.

## Data Representation

### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Decimal Numbers are numbers with a bas of 10
Binary numbers are numbers with a base of 2
Hexadecimal numbers are numbers with a base of 16

### Hexadecimal Color Representation
#ab00ff is representing the color Violet on the color spectrum, rich in magenta, blue, red and cyan
