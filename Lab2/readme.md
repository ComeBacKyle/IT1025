## Executive Summary  

The purpose of Lab 2 is to define and explain the purpose of various hardware components including hard drives, RAM and CPU. Also covered is data representation, covering hexadecimal, binary and decimal numbers and the difference between them. 

## Hardware 

### Hard Drives and Memory 

#### Latency and Transfer Rates 

 Latency refers to the measure of time it takes for information to be readily available after a hard drives read/write head has completed a seek. Transfer rate refers to the time it takes to for data to be written to, or read from RAM. 

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives 

  There are a few differences between SSD and a traditional hard drive. The first is the functionality of the hard ware itself. With a Traditional hard drive having so many pieces and moving parts to it, it becomes more of a liability when comparing it to SSD. One small thing could break and then you’d be out of luck. The minimal amounts of moving parts as well as the size of the SSD, keeps it from being susceptible to dust entering or any moving part having a malfunction. Another difference between the two is speed. Because of the before mentioned moving parts. The hard drive can bring in a bit of latency, this showing in the seeking time, as the disk and spindle have to coordinate in efforts to find the data that is need. Even with all parts moving like a well-oiled machine the hard drive still presents a bit of a slowed just based on having more to do. The SSD on the other hand doesn’t present the same problem. Because all of its functionality is running through NAND and sometime SDRAM, all of the data that has to be recalled almost at your fingertips. This is the same processes for fragmented data as well. 

  

#### Random Access Memory 

  RAM is a critical component on a computer.  There are a few reasons why you would want to increase your RAM. One of the most obvious reasons is because it Speeds up your computer, with a larger amount of RAM you are also increasing the amount of information you are able to output.  Another reason is that with a larger amount of RAM you are taking the workload off the hard drive, thus allowing that to maintain its top speeds. The difference between a 32- and 64-bit path is pretty simple, 64-bit path transfers 64 bits of information per clock cycle in comparison to only doing half that for the 32-bit path. 

### ALU and the Control Unit 

The ALU sits inside the CPU alongside the Control unit and is responsible for all the math problems that need to be done. 

The ALU receives instruction from the Control Unit and then preforms the tasks that is asked of it. 

  

### CPU, Input & Output 

So, in the situation of the gas station, the actual pump would act as the CPU. The customer would then input money to represent the amount of gas they would want. And the Output would be the gas that comes out. 

### Logic Gates 

A truth table simply gives a visual of the 4 possible outcomes for a logic gate. With an AND logic gate the truth table would show that 3 of the 4 out comes would produce a 0 (off). Because with an AND logic gate you need 2 “on” inputs to have an “on” output. The difference with a OR is that you only need one “on” input to produce an “on" output. So, an OR logic gate truth table would show that 3 of the 4 possible outcomes would produce an output of “on”. 

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design 

IEEE has a strong focus on ethics, IEEE understand the amount of power that tech can have on the world. Their purpose is to uphold ethics and practice ethical behavior. 

  
## Data Representation 

  

### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal 

Decimal Numbers: Are numbers with a base of 10, there are 10 digits (0-9) that is used to represent decimal numbers. 

Binary Numbers: Are numbers with a base of 2, there are 2 digits (0,1) that are used to represent binary numbers. 

Hexadecimal Numbers: Are numbers with a base of 16, there are 16 digits that represent hexadecimal numbers. The digits are 0-9 and A-F used together to represent hexadecimal numbers. 

  

### Hexadecimal Color Representation 

#ab00ff is representing the color Violet on the color spectrum, rich in magenta, blue, red and cyan. 

  

  

## Conclusion 

In conclusion from Lab 2, a few takeaways are that transfer rates and latency rates are important barometers for a how well a hard drive is working. RAM is a critical part of a computer; with the correct amount of RAM the hard drive can perform at its top level. I also learned the difference between decimal, binary, hexadecimal number systems and how each one differs from each other.
