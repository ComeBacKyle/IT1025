## Executive Summary  

The purpose of lab 3 is to define software types, learn what virtualization is and how is used, learn the basic of Python. Example code of python will be excercised.  

## Software 

### Types of Software 

Operating System is used to manage the hardware resources to a computer, while providing a platform for developers to write applications. Examples are: Microsoft Windows. 

  

Application software is used to perform a certain task or goal. An example of this is Microsoft word. 

  

Utility software is software that allows you to fix or modify your computer. Examples of this is an anti-malware software. 

### ERP 

ERP's purpose is to bring an enterprises information under one central location or program. An example of an ERP is a Customer Relationship management for an insurance company. 

  

## Virtualization 

### Problems Solved by Virtualization 

A common problem solved by virtualization is lowering the number of servers needed. With using virtualization, you can have one server splitting itself among 2 different tasks. 

### Role of Hypervisor 

A hypervisor creates virtual environments to allow VM to separate from the main source of data while maintaining connection 

  

## Python 

### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python 

What is meant is that Python has an easier time converting from human language to computer code. The nature of python is that when writing or reading most of it is similar to English allowing a better flow for Pseudo-Code. 

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language 

There are a few differences between Interpreted and Compiled: interpreted languages execute instructions directly, while compiled are normally made of compilers. 

Interpreted languages translate just one statement at a time, while compiled does the entire program. Compilers also can't identify or fix errors. 

  

## Career Exploration 

### Handshake 

### Bureau of Labor Statistics 

Few interesting facts from the BOL, the growth rate for IT jobs thru 2030 is 13%, some of the top jobs are 

Computer Programmer 

Software Developer 

Computer Support Specialist 

### Certifications 

CompTIA- Acts as a gateway into the tech field for some people. With little to know experience you can get a help desk job with a CompTIA Cert. 

Cisco- Opens the door for higher certs, starting with a beginner cert all the way up to Architect. 

CISSP- Is designed to help you get a security job. 

### Certificates and Degrees 

A few Certs and degrees I'm interested in are Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, Computer Networking. 

### Co-ops / Internships 

### Industry Associations / Student Organizations 

  

## Conclusion 

What I have learned from this lab is, Virtualization is used to help maintain server usage, through virtualization many companies can cut cost as well as solve a common problem. I learned a few different types of certs and how they can align with my current career path. I was able to do some research on different jobs and salaries with the information on certs. I learn what and how to pseudo code, and how the python language is pseudo-code friendly. Python has an easier type being converted from pseudo-code to computer language.
