## Executive Summary  

Lab5 will intriduce IP address and the significance of them it will also define a secure web page and how to recognize one. TCP/IP communication between devices and SSL protocols  

## Internet Architecture 

### Internet Protocol 

#### IP Address 

An Internet Protocol Address (IP Adress) is a set of number assigned to a computers network interface. 

The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is IPv4 uses 4 numbers separated by periods. IPv6 uses 6 numbers separated by colons. Also, with the IPv4 the numbers range from 0-255. IPv6 uses the hexadecimal numbers system. 

#### ICANN 

ICANN allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries around the world. From there the blocks are broken down into smaller IP address in hierarchical system. Through this process it contributes to the global internet. 

  

### TCP/IP 

#### Responsibility of TCP/IP 

TCP/IP is a secure way that two devices can communicate, using a virtual IP port a private two-way communication channel is created. 

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP 

In a TCP/IP connection the computer that dials out for the other computer would act as the client. It needs and IP address as well the port needed to establish a connection. The only the other computer (server) has to do is listen for incoming request and either accept or reject them. Once connection has been established data can transfer freely. 

#### Layers 

Layers are important because if ever there is a need to change something in the process the use of layers allows you to change one thing without affecting the other. So, if you needed to change the mail route for a mail delivery truck to something different you could do so with affecting how the mail room employee does their job. 

#### Application Layer 

  

## Internet Security 

### HTTP and Client-Server Model 

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol; it is the protocol used to view web pages on the internet. HTTP is used to communicate between a computer and a web server. Any information sent from the computer is saved in the server and can be retrieved. With this method it supports the client-server model. 

### Protocols for Secure HTTP 

HTTPS uses encrypted text to transfer data from a computer to a web server. It also indicates when a user is on a secured network by adding an “s” to http. With the use of SSL, a website can communicate and authenticate its identity with a website before the server will open up to it. Once the server sends a secure certificate the line is recognized as secure. 

  

## Securing your Web Browser 

### Reasons to Secure Browser 

One reason of the many you should secure your browser is because not all third-party apps, or factory installed software adjusts to security updates. 

### Risk Explained 

An Example of a risk is ActiveX, which sometimes uses parts of applications to be utilized by a web browser. This opens up vulnerabilities for a hacker to get in if not properly implemented.
