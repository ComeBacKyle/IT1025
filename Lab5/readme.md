## Executive Summary 

The purpose of lab 5 is to identify networking components, topologies, diagrams, and the role of the NSA in networking security. Also define security encryption technologies and approaches to cybersecurity.

## Introduction to Networking 

  

### Data Transmission 

#### Packet: Unit of Data 

#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 

#### IP Address: Unique identifying number 

 #### DNS: Directory of IP address common names.  For example, 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 

 #### Protocol:  Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

### Networking Hardware 

#### Switch vs. Hub 

A hub is not intelligent, meaning it cannot learn the mac address of devices that plug to it. Thus, it cannot separate which device should receive what information. A switch has the ability to do that. The switch also saves mac addresses to help with send information to a specific port. 

#### Router vs. Switch and Hub 

A router can forward data based on IP address, something a hub or switch cannot do. The router can determine weather information should be received or sent to a different network. A router can connect a network to the internet. With that it gives the ability to receive information from outside networks 

### Network Topologies 

#### Single point of Failure 

When the central hub of a star topology goes down 

#### Infrastructure vs. Wireless Mesh 

Both topologies have a usefulness I would say that in a scenario where you have limited wireless items and also a smaller space infrastructure would create a more secure network. If the wireless connection goes down then you still have an ethernet connection to devices that may be more sensitive to connection lost. I would suggest infrastructure topology for places like a bank. Wireless mesh would be beneficial to a building with multiple floors, multiple wireless devices and who network connection wouldn’t damage any data. A good place for something like this would be a coffee shop or a gas station. 

 

 
### Network Design 

### NSA/CSS 

The NSA uses seven core functions and missions to help prevent and eradicate threats to US national security systems. NSA has implemented multiple catch points from different angles to help defend the US, among the catch points are an emphasis on nuclear command & systems threats, vulnerability, risk, and cryptographic products & services. NSA also hires the best cybersecurity personnel around the world to protect against threats.   

  

## Cybersecurity and Encryption 

  

### Information Systems Security 

  

#### Security Triad 

Amazons online chat would start by being on a secure website that is amazon.com. Being on the website should provide confidentiality that the person you are communicating with is authorized to view your account and personal information. Along with that you can gather that a secure website shows good integrity by the company, if you needed to send information to the online specialist you could do so knowing that there won't be hacker who will steal your information. Lastly amazon.com is an online retailer whose servers should be running 24 hours a day. This allows for accessibility to your information whenever you'd need it or whenever you need to change something. This is how amazon.com works withing the security triad. 

#### Authentication 

One daily task that I have to go through is unlocking my phone. Using my fingerprint as a single factor authentication. This could easily be turned into a multi factor by adding a facial scan to the process. Another daily task is locking my house door, using my key and a four-digit pin would turn this into a multi factor authentication. The third daily task I use is logging into my student dashboard, adding a security question to this would create a multi factor authentication. To make it stronger you could have the question change periodically. 

#### ACL and RBAC 

The purpose of ACL and RBAC, is to regulate the access a specific employee has. ACL and RBAC are access control tools that can mitigate information getting into the wrong hands. ACL has a setback, because it operates like a list, where every employee would be listed and each Access would be granted to each person individually. As for RBAC you can create a database that would house the access for certain positions. And then you can assign those certain roles to each person individually, the setback here is that if one person needs more access outside their scope you'd have to go in and manually correct that. 

#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key 

If a person wants to send a message, they will use a public key to encrypt and send in through a communication channel. The recipient would then use a private key to decode the message. The communication channel that is used to send the message between the two would use ciphertext to hide the actual message so you might see lorem ipsum to decode it. 

#### Public Key Cryptography 

Public key cryptography is important because there are bits of information that needs to be sent through public transmission channels that is only intended for the recipient. 

  
### Cryptography 

#### Encryption 

I included a screenshot of my output. My encrypted message was shifted by 5 letters, so in order to reverse it you have to take each letter back 5 letters to get the original. 

#### Frequency Fingerprint 

When you type your message into the frequency finger print you get a count of the letters individually. This would of course change if you switched languages, in English e is the most used letter another language it could be another letter. 

#### Polyalphabetic Cipher 

A polyalphabetic cipher is a code that uses a shift word to encrypt the message, using the length of the word a strength barometer the frequency fingerprint is increasingly harder to dictate. 

#### Polyalphabetic Example 

My message was shifted using the word dictionary as shown in the screenshot my message was completely scrambled when encrypted. 

  
#### Brute-Force 

  
## Conclusion 

In conclusion lab 5 shows the fundamentals of networking. How using different networking infrastructures can be more beneficial than others in certain situations. I have defined multiple parts of cybersecurity, including discussing ACL, RBAC two different access control tools that can be used. Cryptography and encryption were discussed as well as ancient cryptography that was used to pass messages during wars.
